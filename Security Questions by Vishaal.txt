# All participants have agreed to giving their opinions in this survey and permission was granted. 

What is the liklihood that you as the user will forget the answer to your own security questions if you don't write them down?

* Most people answered: I don't know, I guess I would just reset my security questions. 

What would be the best security question?

* What is my favorite car?

* What is my pet's name?

* What is my mother's maiden name?

What is the liklihood of a good attempt to a security question by just guessing

* Most people said around 30-40%

How easy is it to find security questions online?

* Most people said around 50% as well as depends on the person and if they decide to put an answer not related to the sercurity question. 

What is the liklihood that people will write down the answers to their security questions?

* Around 60% of people will write down the answers to the security questions.

If family members type in the answer to the user's security questions without having to look them up online, will this create vulnerbilites?

* Most users replied with yes it can create a vulnerbility because the information can still be shared to other people around the world. 

How often do people give fake answers to questions and will this make it easier or harder to answer?

* Most people answered that around 50% of users may give fake answers and can make it harder to answer. 

Conclussion: After interviwing individuals on security questions, I was able to find some of the answers online. The questions I was able to look up were: 

* What is your mother's maiden name?  #The user didn't believe I could look this question up.

* In what city was your father born?  #The user didn't believe I could look this question up.

* What was your middle school's mascot?

* About 89% of people said that the answer to this question can be looked up.

Note: At the end of this project, I learned that nothing is 100% secure, and answering a security question with a false answer that can't be tracked back to the user's true identity is the safest way.
